The config file Interhack checks first is ~/.interhack/config. Each config line
can be broken into multiple lines (for readability) by using \ at the end of
the line. Also, comments can be used; # comments to the end of the line. There
are several types of config lines:

  nick NICK
    This sets your autologin nickname to NICK.
      nick Eidolos

  pass PASS
    This sets your autologin pass to PASS. See below on setting passwords.
      pass foob3

  color COLOR REGEX
    This colorizes any string matched by REGEX to COLOR. See below on what
    valid colors are. Also, the config reader can parse NetHack-style MENUCOLOR
    lines.
      color red You are slowing down

  map KEY STRING
    This remaps KEY to send STRING instead of KEY. It's not very powerful right
    now because you can't define ctrl-keys or anything fancy. So wait on this.
      map ~ #enhance\n

  annotate /REGEX/ MESSAGE
    This sets up an annotation for strings matching REGEX. (note that you can
    choose any delimiter instead of /) When a string matching REGEX is seen,
    then MESSAGE is displayed on the second line in dark gray.
      annotate /You feel cool!/ You just got fire resistance!

  tab /REGEX/ STRING
    This sets up a "tab". When a string matching REGEX is seen, then a tab is
    set up such that when the player presses tab, STRING is sent.
      tab /What do you want to name this gray stone/ the Heart of Ahriman

  eval CODE
    This lets you run CODE for each chunk of input. The input is in $_, which
    you can modify to have an effect on what is sent to the screen, or do other
    fancy things.
      eval if (m{ Xp: \d+ / (\d+) }x) { \
        annotate "You gain " . ($1 - $oldexp) . " experience." \
          unless $1 == $oldexp; \
        $oldexp = $1 }

  s/REGEX/REPLACEMENT/OPTS
    This is just a shortcut for eval s/REGEX/REPLACEMENT/OPTS. You can of
    course choose your own delimiters.
      s/You hear someone counting money\./There is a vault on this level. /g

  keval CODE
    This lets you run CODE for each chunk of user input. The key (or keys!) is
    in $_, which you can modify to have an effect on what is sent to the
    server, or do other fancy things. kevals are run in order and if a
    replacement is made, it still keeps going with the new keystrokes to send
    to the server.
      keval if ($_ eq "~" && $at_login) { $_ = "q" }

Passwords:

While you can put your password in ~/.interhack/config, it's probably not a
good idea (since it makes sharing more difficult). So instead you can make
files such as ~/.interhack/Eidolos which would contain the password to the
account Eidolos (any player named "config" might be out of luck here!). Make
sure that these files are unreadable to others ('chmod 700 ~/.interhack' is
probably your best bet)
