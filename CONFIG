The config file Interhack checks first is ~/.interhack/config. The config file is pure Perl, so these can get arbitrarily complex. Here are some helper functions you can use.

  nick "NICK";
    This sets your autologin nickname to NICK.
      nick "Eidolos";

  pass "PASS";
    This sets your autologin pass to PASS. See below on setting passwords.
      pass "foob3";

  recolor qr/REGEX/ => "COLOR";
    This colorizes any string matched by REGEX to COLOR. See below on what
    valid colors are. Also, the config reader can parse NetHack-style MENUCOLOR
    lines.
      color red You are slowing down

  remap "KEY" => "STRING";
    This remaps KEY to send STRING instead of KEY. It's not very powerful right
    now because you can't define ctrl-keys or anything fancy. So wait on this.
      remap chr(5) => "E-  Elbereth\n";

  make_annotation qr/REGEX/ => "MESSAGE";
    This sets up an annotation for strings matching REGEX. When a string matching REGEX is seen, then MESSAGE is displayed on the second line in dark gray.
      make_annotation qr/You feel cool!/ => "You just got fire resistance!";

  make_tab qr/REGEX/ => "STRING";
    This sets up a "tab". When a string matching REGEX is seen, then a tab is
    set up such that when the player presses tab, STRING is sent.
      make_tab "\e[What do you want to name this gray stone?"
            => "the Heart of Ahriman\n";

Passwords:

While you can put your password in ~/.interhack/config, it's probably not a
good idea (since it makes sharing more difficult). So instead you can make
files such as ~/.interhack/Eidolos which would contain the password to the
account Eidolos (any player named "config" might be out of luck here!). Make
sure that these files are unreadable to others ('chmod 700 ~/.interhack' is
probably your best bet)
