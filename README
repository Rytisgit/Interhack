Interhack is a layer that sits between you and your NetHack server (which we'll
call NAO) and plays with the text going both ways. For example, this could be
used to color the message "You are slowing down" in bright red.

Building:

There's only one step to building Interhack, which is to build the Mastermind
program, written in C. The following is all you need:

  make

If running Interhack produces an error that resembles "Can't locate $FOO.pm in
@INC", you need to install modules via CPAN. Use "cpan -i $FOO" (possibly as
root).

Configuration:

See CONFIG for information about the configuration file.
